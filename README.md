# Snake-Game
Project Overview: Classic Snake Game
This repository contains a classic Snake Game built using Python’s Turtle Graphics module. The project demonstrates the use of modular programming, inheritance, and real-time event handling to create an interactive gaming experience.

Key Features
Object-Oriented Design: The game logic is split into dedicated classes for the Snake, Food, and Scoreboard to ensure clean, maintainable code.

Collision Detection: Implements precise logic to detect when the snake eats food, hits a wall, or collides with its own tail.

Real-Time Controls: Uses keyboard listeners to allow users to navigate the snake in four directions.

Dynamic Scoring: Features an on-screen scoreboard that updates instantly and displays a "Game Over" message upon defeat.

Technical Stack
Language: Python 3

Library: Turtle Graphics (Standard Library)

Concepts: OOP (Classes/Inheritance), Coordinate Systems, List Manipulation.
